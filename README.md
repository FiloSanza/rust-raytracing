# Rust-Raytracing
This is a simple library graphics that implements ray tracing in rust, the main goal is to realize a library that allows to render different objects (like speheres and cubes) made of diferent materials.

This project is inspired by the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) guide.

## Features

- Positionable camera
- Positionable objects of different materials
- Antialiasing
- Multithreading rendering

## Todo
- [x] Make the rendering process multithreaded
- [ ] Implement a Scene class that controls the rendering process
- [ ] Use images as textures
- [ ] Export the image in different formats
- [ ] Different shapes
